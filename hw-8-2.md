### 2. a)

make a meta graph (V + E) each node is an scc

and then if there is two or more 2 sinks then there are no happy nodes

How to check if sinks? is this still linear time (if adjacency list is empty)

```
ContainsKHappyNodes(G):
    G' = FindSCC(G)
    sinks <- 0:
    sink_component

    for all v in G':

        if v is a sink: // O(1)
            sink_component = v
            sinks <- sinks + 1

    if sinks >= 2:
        return False
    else:
        return size(sink_component) >= k
```

### 2. b)

two or less edges to make G strongly connected

make a meta graph (V + E) each node is an scc

do a topological sort and then loop through the nodes and check adjacent nodes for how many connections needed to be made

```
StronglyConnectedWithTwo(G)
    G' = FindSCC(G) // O(V + E)
    S[1....|V'|]= TopologicalSort(G')
    count <- 0

    for i <- 1 to |V'| - 1:
        if there is no edge between S[i] and S[i + 1 ]:
            count += 1

    if there is no edge between S[|V'|] and S[1]
        count += 1

    return (count <= 2)

```
