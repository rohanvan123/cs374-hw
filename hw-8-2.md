### 2. a)

An optimal approach to this problem is to
make a meta graph (V + E) each node is an scc

and then if there is two or more 2 sinks then there are no happy nodes

How to check if sinks? is this still linear time (if adjacency list is empty)

```
ContainsKHappyNodes(G):
    G' = FindSCC(G)
    sinks <- 0:
    sink_component

    for all v in G':

        if v is a sink: // O(1)
            sink_component = v
            sinks <- sinks + 1

    if sinks >= 2 or sinks = 0:
        return False
    else:
        return size(sink_component) >= k
```

### 2. b)

The algorithm for determining if a directed graph can be converted to a strongly connected graph using at most 2 edges works as follows:

1. Obtain the meta-graph (DAG) of our original graph
2. Count the number of sources and sinks in our meta-graph
3. The meta-graph can have at most 2 sources and 2 sinks, otherwise return false

The reasoning as to why this works can be justified as follows. There are two trivial cases for our meta-graph:

$\bullet$ Case 1: no SCCs (no nodes) this is trivialy a strongly connected graph by definiition

$\bullet$ Case 2: 1 SCC because there is only one strongly connected component, it itself is our graph G, which implies that G is already strongly connected

For the basic case, when there is one source and one sink in our meta graph, this can be made strongly connected by adding one edge from our sink to our source.

For cases with more sinks and sources, we can recursively induce then as follows:

$\bullet$ **1 source and 2 sinks** - For this case you could add one edge from one sink to the original source. Now, we have formed a strongly connected component acting as our source poiting to our remaning sink. This becomes the same problem as our 1 source 1 sink case, which requires only 1 edge. Therefore it is a total of two edges

$\bullet$ **2 sources and 1 sink** - For this case you could add one edge from one sink to one of the sources. Now, we have formed a strongly connected component acting as our single sink, where our untouched source points to that sink component. This becomes the same problem as our 1 source 1 sink case, which requires only 1 edge. Therefore it is a total of two edges

$\bullet$ **2 sources and 2 sinks** - For this case, we know that there are two cases: the meta graph has 2 connected components or 1. For when it has two, we could make both sinks point to the sources of the other connected component. This ensures reachability for all nodes. For when our graph is fully connected. We would essentially perform the same process. Creating an edge from one sink to a source, and the other sink to the other source. This would ensure that we can travel from one source to the other sink, which connects to the other source.

The reason why this doesnt work for any cases with 3 or more sinks or sources is becasue of the recursive intution we applied above. For example, if we have 3 sources and 1 sink. We would created an edge from the sink to one of our sources, reducing the problems to a 2 sources and 1 sink problem, which requires 2 edges.

Here is the basic psuedocode for our algorithm

```
StronglyConnectedWithTwo(G)
    G' = FindSCC(G) // O(V + E)
    G'_rev = Reverse(G') // O(V + E)

    sinks <- 0
    sources <- 0

    for v each in V':
        if v is a sink:
            // in an adjacency list this is O(1) because we just check the length of its outgoing edges
            sinks <- sinks + 1

    for v each in V'_Rev:
        if v is a sink:
            // in an adjacency list this is O(1) because we just check the length of its outgoing edges
            // a sink in the reversal is a source in the actual
            sources <- sources + 1


    return (sources <= 2 and sinks <= 2)

```

**Explanation and Analysis**

This function above performs the steps defined above. It first obtains the meta-graph G' which is a blackbox problem that is $O(V+ E)$. It then finds the reversal of that meta-graph which is also $O(V + E)$, as it is a blackbox routine defined in this class. From there we iterate through each vertex in V' and count the number of sinks and then each vertex in V'\_Rev and count the number of sources (each sink in V'\_Rev is a source in the actual). This is $O(V)$. Finally we return True the number of sinks and sources are less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the overall time complixet is linear, with it running in $O(V+ E)$.
