### 2. a)

A linear time algorithm for determining if a directed graph has at least k happy nodes is defined as follows:

1. Obtain the meta-graph (DAG) of our original graph
2. Count the number of sinks in our meta-graph
3. If there is only one sink, then the number of happy nodes is the number of nodes in that sinks
4. Otherwise, return 0

The reasoning behind why this algorithm works can be explained briefly. We need to retrieve the metagraph becasue each set of nodes in a meta node is reachable with eachother. Hence, if there is only one meta-sink, then every node can reach that sink, meaning that every node in our single meta-sink is happy. However, for the trivial case of no sinks, this means that there are no nodes in our graph in the first place, meainign 0 happy nodes. When there are 2 or more sinks. The nodes in different sinks are not reachable to eachother, meaning that there are 0 happy nodes because no single node is reachable from all the other nodes.

Here is the psuedocode for this algorithm:

```
ContainsKHappyNodes(G, k):
    G' = FindSCC(G)
    sinks <- 0:
    sink_component

    for all v in V':
        if v is a sink: // O(1)
            sink_component = v
            sinks <- sinks + 1

    if sinks == 1
        return size(sink_component) >= k
    else:
        return False
```

**Explanation and Analysis**

This function above performs the steps defined earlier. It first obtains the meta-graph G' by calling FindSCC(G) which is a blackbox problem that is $O(V + E)$. Secondly, it then defines a variable sinks to count the number of sinks and sink_component to keep track of the most recent component (for this case of 1 sink, this stores the only sink component). It then loops over the set of vertices an V' and check if v is a sink, which can be done in constant time with an adjacecny--just by checkin the size of the list of outgoing nodes. If v is a sink it updates our counter and updates sink_component accordingly. This for loop is $O(V)$. At the end it if the number of sinks is 1, the function returns true if and only if the number of nodes in our sink component, which can be compouted in linear time or even constant depending on how we store our G' meta graph, is greater than or equal to k; otherwise, we return false for all cases. Hence, the overall time complexity is linear--$O(V + E)$ because we need to compute our metagraph and iterate through the list of vertices.

### 2. b)

The algorithm for determining if a directed graph can be converted to a strongly connected graph using at most 2 edges works as follows:

1. Obtain the meta-graph (DAG) of our original graph
2. Count the number of sources and sinks in our meta-graph
3. The meta-graph can have at most 2 sources and 2 sinks, otherwise return false

The reasoning as to why this works can be justified as follows. There are two trivial cases for our meta-graph:

$\bullet$ **Base Case 1**: no SCCs (no nodes) this is trivialy a strongly connected graph by definiition

$\bullet$ **Base Case 2**: 1 SCC because there is only one strongly connected component, it itself is our graph G, which implies that G is already strongly connected

For the basic case, when there is one source and one sink in our meta graph, this can be made strongly connected by adding one edge from our sink to our source.

For cases with more sinks and sources, we can recursively induce then as follows:

$\bullet$ **1 source and 2 sinks** - For this case you could add one edge from one sink to the original source. Now, we have formed a strongly connected component acting as our source poiting to our remaning sink. This becomes the same problem as our 1 source 1 sink case, which requires only 1 edge. Therefore it is a total of two edges

$\bullet$ **2 sources and 1 sink** - For this case you could add one edge from one sink to one of the sources. Now, we have formed a strongly connected component acting as our single sink, where our untouched source points to that sink component. This becomes the same problem as our 1 source 1 sink case, which requires only 1 edge. Therefore it is a total of two edges

$\bullet$ **2 sources and 2 sinks** - For this case, we know that there are two cases: the meta graph has 2 connected components or 1. For when it has two, we could make both sinks point to the sources of the other connected component. This ensures reachability for all nodes. For when our graph is fully connected. We would essentially perform the same process. Creating an edge from one sink to a source, and the other sink to the other source. This would ensure that we can travel from one source to the other sink, which connects to the other source.

The reason why this doesnt work for any cases with 3 or more sinks or sources is becasue of the recursive intution we applied above. For example, if we have 3 sources and 1 sink. We would created an edge from the sink to one of our sources, reducing the problems to a 2 sources and 1 sink problem, which requires 2 edges.

Here is the basic psuedocode for our algorithm

```
StronglyConnectedWithTwo(G)
    G' = FindSCC(G) // O(V + E)
    G'_rev = Reverse(G') // O(V + E)

    sinks <- 0
    sources <- 0

    for v each in V':
        if v is a sink:
            // in an adjacency list this is O(1) because we just check the length of its outgoing edges
            sinks <- sinks + 1

    for v each in V'_Rev:
        if v is a sink:
            // in an adjacency list this is O(1) because we just check the length of its outgoing edges
            // a sink in the reversal is a source in the actual
            sources <- sources + 1


    return (sources <= 2 and sinks <= 2)

```

**Explanation and Analysis**

This function above performs the steps defined above. It first obtains the meta-graph G' by calling FindSCC(G) which is a blackbox problem that is $O(V+ E)$. It then finds the reversal of that meta-graph which is also $O(V + E)$, as it is a blackbox routine defined in this class. From there we iterate through each vertex in V' and count the number of sinks and then each vertex in V'\_Rev and count the number of sources (each sink in V'\_Rev is a source in the actual). Counting a sink is $O(1)$ because for an adjacency list we would just have to check if the list of outgoing edges is empty. Therefore, for each vertex, this is $O(V)$. Finally we return True the number of sinks and sources are less than or equal to 2. Therefore, the overall time complixet is linear, with it running in $O(V+ E)$.
