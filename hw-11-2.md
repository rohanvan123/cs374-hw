### 2. a)

To Reduce PerfectMatchings to SAT, we need to essentially convert our given graph G into a boolean equation that can be solved by SAT. The conversion process works as follows

1. Assign a boolean variable $x_i$ for each edge $1 \leq  i \leq |E|$ in our graph. When it comes to building out the formula we must impose certain constraints such that no two edges can cover the same vertex and every vertex must be covered by our PerfectMatching $M$
2. The easiest way to construct this boolean fomula is to iterate through each vertex in $V$ and handle the three different cases as follows:

$\bullet$ **Case 1**: Vertex with no edges - for this case, we simply can return false becasue trivially there are no edges that can capture this vertex

$\bullet$ **Case 2**: Vertex with one outgoing edge - for this case, we simply must require the boolean variable corresponding to this edge (wlog soppose it is $x_i$) to be true in order to cover that vertex. We can join this clause to the previous boolean formula that has been constructed so far fomula via the and operator:

$$x_i \ \land \ (prev)$$

$\bullet$ **Case 3**: Vertex with multiple outgoing edges. For this case it is some what more complicated, but we simply need to ensure that out of all the edges connecting to a single vertex, exactly one and only one is picked. To give an example, suppose that $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$ all connect to a vertex, then we can express our clause as

$$\overline{(x_1 \ \land \ x_2) \ \lor (x_1 \ \land \ x_3) \ \lor \ (x_3 \ \land \ x_3)}$$

This clause is false if any two edges connected to the same vertex are chose together.

Using this information each vertex corresponds to some boolean clause and each clause is joined via the and operator. Together, this construction takes $O(n^3)$ worst case becasue if we consider a conplete graph $K_n$, then we would have to consider all $n(n - 1)$ combinations of vertices for all $n$ nodes, which is still a polynomial reduction.

This boolean expression is now reduced to a form that is solvable via the SAT problem, which output true if there exists some assignment of variables that makes the whole expression true.

This does not prove that PerfectMatchings is NP-Complete because it only proves that SAT is at least as hard as PerfectMatchings, but not necessarily the other way around.

**Correctness Proof**

Suppose that I do have a graph $G$ with a perfect matching, then I can can create a boolean formula as described above such that all edges in our set $M$ is marked true and that ones that are not are marked false. We can argue through each case,

1. For the first case, there cannot be a perfect matching becasue there is a vertext with no outgoing edges

2. For the second case, and vertext with the single edge going out, $x_i$, would be marked true

3. For the case where we have multi-edges, the big clause would have to be marked as true impying that only one of the edges has been picked.
