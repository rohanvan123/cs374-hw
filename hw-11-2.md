### 2. a)

To Reduce PerfectMatchings to SAT, we need to essentially convert our given graph G into a boolean equation that can be solved by SAT. The conversion process works as follows

1. Assign a boolean variable $x_i$ for each edge $1 \leq  i \leq |E|$ in our graph. When it comes to building out the formula we must impose certain constraints such that no two edges can cover the same vertex and every vertex must be covered by our PerfectMatching $M$
2. The easiest way to construct this boolean fomula is to iterate through each vertex in $V$ and handle the three different cases as follows:

$\bullet$ **Case 1**: Vertex with no edges - for this case, we simply can return false becasue trivially there are no edges that can capture this vertex

$\bullet$ **Case 2**: Vertex with one outgoing edge - for this case, we simply must require the boolean variable corresponding to this edge (wlog soppose it is $x_i$) to be true in order to cover that vertex. We can join this clause to the previous boolean formula that has been constructed so far fomula via the and operator:

$$x_i \ \land \ (prev)$$

$\bullet$ **Case 3**: Vertex with multiple outgoing edges. For this case it is some what more complicated, but we simply need to ensure that out of all the edges connecting to a single vertex, exactly one and only one is picked. To give an example, suppose that $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$ all connect to a vertex, then we can express our clause as

$$\overline{(x_1 \ \land \ x_2) \ \lor (x_1 \ \land \ x_3) \ \lor \ (x_3 \ \land \ x_3)}$$

This clause is false if any two edges connected to the same vertex are chose together.

Using this information each vertex corresponds to some boolean clause and each clause is joined via the and operator. Together, this construction takes $O(n^3)$ worst case becasue if we consider a conplete graph $K_n$, then we would have to consider all $n(n - 1)$ combinations of vertices for all $n$ nodes, which is still a polynomial reduction.

This boolean expression is now reduced to a form that is solvable via the SAT problem, which output true if there exists some assignment of variables that makes the whole expression true.

This proves that PerfectMatchings is NP-Hard because it is at least as hard as SAT. However, this does not prove that it is NP-Complete because we don't prove that it is in NP.

**Correctness Proof**

Suppose that I do have a graph $G$ with a perfect matching, then I can can create a boolean formula as described above such that all edges in our set $M$ is marked true and that ones that are not are marked false. We can argue through each case,

1. For the first case, there cannot be a perfect matching becasue there is a vertext with no outgoing edges

2. For the second case with a vertex with the single edge connected to it, suppose $x_i$, must be marked true

3. For the case where we have multi-edges, the big clause would have to be marked as true impying that only one of the edges has been picked.

### 2. b)

**Proof:**

To prove that EIGHT is NP-Complete, we need to show that it in is both NP-Hard and NP.

To prove the former, we can reduce Hamiltonian Cycle to the EIGHT problem. Essentially this algorithm accepts a regular graph G as an input, modifies our graph G and outputs true iff EIGHT on this modified graph outputs true. We use EIGHT as a subroutine to prove that it is np-complete.

```
def HamCycle(G):
    G' <- InitGPrime(G)
    return EIGHT(G', n)
```

Our function $InitGPrime(G)$ would create a new graph as follows, pick some arbitrary vertex $v_f \in V$, as it does not matter which vertex we pick since a hamiltonian cycle contains all nodes and can start at any node in our graph. $v_f$ indicates the vertex that we will flip our original graph upon.

Then, using $v_f$, we construct our new graph $G'$ defined below:

$V' = V \cup \{v' \ | \ v \in V, \ v \neq v_f\}$

$E' = E \ \cup \ \{(u', v') \ | \ (u, v) \in E, u \neq v_f, v \neq v_f \} \ \cup \ \{(v_f, v') \ | \ (v_f, v) \in E\}$

In our contruction on $V'$, the set on the right contains $n - 1$ nodes (as it does not include our arbitrary node), giving us a total of $|V'| = 2n - 1$ nodes in our new graph. With this newly constructed graph, we can pass it into EIGHT as a blackbox where $k = n$. Then, $G$ has a Hamiltonian Cycle if and only if $G'$ has an eight-graph on a subgraph consisting of $2n - 1$ nodes (which is the entire graph of $G'$).

Given a graph $G$ that has a hamiltonian cycle, we can obtain a satisfying eight cycle graph by creating a new graph $G'$ as mentioned above, and the EIGHT problem would return true becasue the two cycles of size n are joined by some arbitrary node.

Given a sub graph that is has a valid Eight-Graph, we can check there is a ham cycle by taking one of the nodes and one of the cycles, which gaurantees a Hamiltonian Cycle in the subgraph.

This reduction is polynomial becasue it requires us to choose and arbitrary vertex $v_f$, and create a copy of all the other nodes and edges accordingly, which can be performed in linear time $O(n + m)$. Hence the time complexity of Hamiltonian Cycle is

$$T_{HamCycle} \leq T_{EIGHT} + O(n + m)$$

Therefore becasue HamCycle can be reduced to EIGHT in polynomial time, EIGHT is at least as hard as HamCycle, since we need to solve EIGHT to solve HamCycle, which we know to be NP-Hard. If EIGHT could be solved in polynomial time, then so could HamCycle by the time complexity formula above, which would imply that P = NP, but this is not true as HamCycle is NP-Hard, and therefore EIGHT is also NP-Hard because a known problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time.

To prove that EIGHT is in NP, the solution must be justified in polynomial time. Given a subgraph on $2k - 1$ nodes, we simply need to check that it consists of two cycles C1 and C2 on n nodes each, that C1 and C2 share exactly one node, and that the resulting graph has $2n - 1$ nodes. We can do this in polynomial time by checking each node and edge in the graph.

Since EIGHT is in both NP and NP-Hard, it is also NP-Complete.
