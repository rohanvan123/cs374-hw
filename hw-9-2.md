### 2. a)

There are two cases:
$G = (V, E)$ is a DAG or $G$ is strongly connected

Let $ n = |V|$ and $m = |E|$

1 - If $G$ is already a single strongly connected component--which we can determine in linear time--then we can simply return the weight of all nodes in our graph, since every node is reachable to all the other nodes. This can be completed in linear time $O(n + m)$

2 - If $G$ is a get the SCC meta graph so we can run the BFS longest path algorithm that we learned in class, but we have to account for vertex weights instead of edge weights.

To do this, we will have to split our vertices to v' and v'' and place the edge between them as the node weight of v for each v in $V$.

Therefore, we can construct a new graph:

$G' = (V', E') \ $ where $ \ V' = \{v', \ v'' \ | \ v \in V \}$

$S_1 = \{v' \rightarrow v'' | v \in V\}$ with the weight of these edges $w(v' \rightarrow v'') = w(v)$

$S_2 = \{u'' \rightarrow v' \ | \ (u, v) \in E\}$ with the weight of these edges $w(u' \rightarrow v') = 0$

$E' = S_1 \cup S_2$

This graph can be built in $O(m + n)$ time.

Using $G'$, we will run the linear time BFS longest path with $s'$ as our start vertex and take the max, which we learned in class. This runtime is $O(V'+E')$ which is $O(n + m)$ overall runtime.

For the general case, we will first run the blackbox algorithm to create our metagraph $G^{SCC}$

We will design our meta graph such that each metavertex contains the sum of all the nodes in that coponent. this is because each SCC is a cycle where a person can travel to each node in that component.

This is now reduced to the second case explained above now that $G^{SCC}$ is a DAG. From there we run the same procedures of contructing a new graph with edge weights instead of edge nodes and performing our linear time longest path BFS algorithm that we learned in class. This overall runtime is $O(m + n)$

### 2. b)

For this problem, we will similarly get our $G^{SCC}$ metagraph, but we now add a sentinel node that connects to each source in the metagraph, then run the algorithm from 2a with the sentinel node as our 'starting vertex'. This will end up taking one of the source nodes in our metagraph. The extra step of identifying the source nodes in our metagraph is still linear time. Therefore, the runtime will be $O(V''+E)$ where this time $V'' = V'\cup \{s'\}$ where s' is the sentinel node, which does not take more than linear time--depending on the implementation--and can be simplified to the same run time of $O(V+E)$. The exact steps are as follows:

1. Compute the metagraph
2. Indetify all source nodes in our metagraph
3. add a sentinal node $start$ which has outgoing edges to all the source nodes in our meta graph
4. The problem now reduces to our problem in part 2a with $start$ as our start node.

### 2. c)

Our overall problem here is to find the max value picking max k eggs that you can pick from any of the SCC with any combination. For example, you can pick one from each node if the amount of nodes equals k, or you can pick all k from one singular node in the metagraph.
In order to restrict eggs, we need to first create our SCC metagraph and then topolologically sort the graph so that we can utilize the children first and work our way up. We are also going to sort each node in ascending order to easily gain the maxes $O(nlogn)$ time where n is number of values in a node).

We are going to then perform DP with a bottom-up recurrence using the graph itself as our data structure. We will memoize by storing an array of length k+1 at each node, where each index in the array reflects how many eggs are left to fill. For example, at index 0, there are 0 eggs left to grab from that node.

Our base case here would be any sink or child of our metagraph, where we will have to initialize it to account for only that node. So at index 0, it will be 0, at index 1, it will pick the singular max value, at index 2 it will add the top 2 max values and so on until k. To simplify into mathematical notation: we will use V' to signify the node we are on as our memoization structure, and V as the array that holds all of the values in the SCC. We will zero index V' for simplification.

        Base Case:
        if V is a sink:
                V'[0] = 0
                V'[1] = V[1]
                ....
                V'[k] = sum(V[1...k])
        Recursive Case:
            V'[0] = max(each outgoing edge'[1])
            ...
            V'[k] = sum(V[1..k]) + max(each outgoing edge'[k + 1])

        We would then return the max of the max value of each source.

This will evaluate from sinks up to source in reverse topological order.

The work at each level is linear, so the most work we have is looping through each node which is |V| and then sorting each node which is $O(m + n^2logn)$ worst case, which would be our overall runtime.
