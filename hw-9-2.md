### 2. a)

Maze (digraph), each node has w(v) eggs located at it.
starting a given node s, has to figure out the max number of eggs they can collect (eggs can only be collected once)

1. get SCCs, meaning each has the total number of eggs for each cycl , so now we have our meta graph that is a DAG

2. run BFS longest path

3. linear time

### 2. b)

1. Get SCCs
2. Topological sort the meta graph
3. connect a sentitnal node to each source in our meta graph.
4. then run bfs
5. return any from the source with the longest
6. Do we need to say the actaul source or just the max?

### 2. c)

you restrict eggs so that they can collect eggs from at most k locations, where k is a parameter you give them.

2d dp array

k different runs for DP algorithm
