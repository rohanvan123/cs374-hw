### 1. a)

For the sake of argument, suppose there is an algorithm DecideAcceptRegular that correctly decides L_regular.

        DecideHalt(<M, w>):
            Encode the following Turing Machine M':
                M'(x):
                run M on input w
                return True
            if DecideAcceptRegular(M'):
                return True
            else:
                return False

To prove this reduction correct:

- Suppose M halts on input w, then M' must accept ANY input string x. If M' accepts any input, the regular language must be accepted too. So, DecideAcceptRegular accepts the encoding <M'>, and therefore DecideHalt correctly accepts <M, w>.
  -Suppose M doesn't halt on input w. Then M' accepts NO input string x, which includes the regular language. Then DecideAcceptRegular rejects <M'>, and therefore DecideHalt rejects <M, w>.

In both cases, DecideHalt either accepts or rejects, however, that is not possible since HALT is undecidable. Therefore, DecideAcceptRegular does not exist and is therefore undecidable.

### 1. b)

For Lu <= LHALT, that means that Lu must reduce to LHALT.
Therefore we need to satisfy the below conditions by construction a reduction from Lu to LHALT with the machine M':

1. If <M,w> is in Lu, then <M'> is in LHALT
2. If <M, w> is not in Lu, then <M'> is not in LHALT

where we will define Turing Machine M' that:

- run M on input w
- if M halts, then M' must halt on blank input (if it halts on any input, it must halt on a blank one)
- else if M does not halt, M' does not halt

Now back to our 2 conditions:

1. If <M, w> is in Lu: M accepts w by the definition of Lu, and therefore, M halts on w, so M' halts on blank input with the described M', so M' is in L_HALT.
2. If <M, w> is not in Lu: M does not accept W and therefore M does not halt, so M' does not halt, so M' is not in L_HALT.

With both conditions satisfied, Lu can be reduced to LHALT.
