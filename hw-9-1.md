### 1. a)

Graph modeling problem. Given A set X of empanada shops, Y gas stations, find the shortest path from s to t given that she has D miles left and must travel to on empanada shop.

to find the closest Gas Station, we can do dijkstras on s, disjkstras on t reversed and find one

$$ V' = V \times \{NE, E\} \times \{NG, G\}$$

Building $E'$:

```
nodes_remove = []
dist_s = Dijkstra's(G, s)
for all nodes v != s:
    if dist(v) > D:
        nodes_remove.add(v)
```

for all states (u, e, NG), if u is in nodes_remove, then we do not add any edges to it. Let R be the same set as nodes_remove. We can build our first set of edges as:

$ S_1 = \{(u, e, NG) \rightarrow (v, e, NG) | \ u,v \notin R, (u, v) \in E, e \in \{NE ,E \}\}$

$w_2((u, e, NG) \rightarrow (v, e, NG)) = w(u \rightarrow v)$

for all states in (u, e, G), we want to keep them the same simply becaseu all nodes are reachable after we have retrieved gas:

$ S_2 = \{(u, e, G) \rightarrow (v, e, G) \ | \ (u, v) \in E, e \in \{NE ,E \}\}$

$w_2((u, e, G) \rightarrow (v, e, G)) = w(u \rightarrow v)$

if u is an empanada station, then:
there is an edge from (u, NE, g) -> (u, E, g), with weight 0
where g is either G or NG. We can define our transition sets

$T = \{ (u, e, NG) \rightarrow (u, e, G) \ | \ \forall u \in Y, e \in \{NE ,g\} \} \ \cup \ \{ (u, e, NG) \rightarrow (u, NE, g) \ | \ \forall u \in Y, g \in \{NG ,G\} \}$

the weight of all the edges in T is 0 because they are transition edges from one state to another

$E' = S_1 \cup S_2 \cup T$

```
dist = Dijkstra's(G', (s, NE, NG))
return min{ dist((t, E, NG)), dist((t, E, G)) }
```

Overall runtime of our algorithm is $O(m * \log n)$

### 1. b)

Assume Yulie us driving to visit a friend in a different state and has to fill up gas multiple times, where each full tank of gas lets her drive R miles. Describe an algorithm that minimizes her driving distance, assuming she starts with a full tank of gas

Assuming X is our set of gas stations and Y is our set of empanada houses

Build a new Graph $G'$
E.

```
dist_s = Dijkstra's(G, s)
for all x in X:
    if dist(x) <= R
        add edge in G' from s to x with weight dist(x)

```

start at (s, R)

consider all reachable nodes

for all reachable gas statsions
run dijkstras on them
run dijkstras at every gas station

### 2. a)

Maze (digraph), each node has w(v) eggs located at it.
starting a given node s, has to figure out the max number of eggs they can collect (eggs can only be collected once)

1. get SCCs, meaning each has the total number of eggs for each cycl , so now we have our meta graph that is a DAG

2. run BFS longest path

3. linear time

### 2. b)

1. Get SCCs
2. Topological sort the meta graph
3. connect a sentitnal node to each source in our meta graph.
4. then run bfs
5. return any from the source with the longest
6. Do we need to say the actaul source or just the max?

### 2. c)

you restrict eggs so that they can collect eggs from at most k locations, where k is a parameter you give them.

2d dp array

k different runs for DP algorithm
