### 1. a)

Graph modeling problem. Given A set X of empanada shops, Y gas stations, find the shortest path from s to t given that she has D miles left and must travel to on empanada shop

to find the closest Gas Station, we can do dijkstras on s, disjkstras on t reversed and find one

$$ V' = V \times \{NE, E\} \times (\{0, ..., D\} \cup \{\infty\})$$

For all edges $u -> v \in E$:
if an node contains an empanada shop

### 1. b)

Assume Yulie us driving to visit a friend in a different state and has to fill up gas multiple times, where each full tank of gas lets her drive R miles. Describe an algorithm that minimizes her driving distance, assuming she starts with a full tank of gas

### 2. a)

Maze (digraph), each node has w(v) eggs located at it.
starting a given node s, has to figure out the max number of eggs they can collect (eggs can only be collected once)

- covert nodes to edges, run longest path algorithm

### 2. b)

this time let them chose the starting node

### 2. c)

you restrict eggs so that they can collect eggs from at most k locations, where k is a parameter you give them.
