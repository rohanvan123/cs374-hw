### 1. a)

This is a graph modeling and Dijkstra's problem. Given a set X of empanada shops, Y gas stations, find the shortest path from s to t given that she has D miles left and must travel to on empanada shop.

We can construct a new graph $ G' = (V', \ E')$:

$$ V' = V \times \{NE, E\} \times \{NG, G\}$$

This is essentially our original graph G with 4 layers, the NE, E represents that the driver has "Not visted the empanda shop" (NE) and
has visited the empanada shop (E). The NG, G represents the fact that the driver has "Not visited a gas station" (NG) and has "visited a gas station" (G). This is still $O(4n)$ nodes, which is $O(n)$ in terms of size.

Building $E'$:

To construct our new set of edges, we first have to run Dijkstra's on our original graph and record the set of all vertices v whose shortest path from s to v is greater than the miles left in our tank D. This set R, represents all vertices that are not reachable without filling gas.

Here is a basic psuedocode of building our set $R$, of unreachable vertices:

```
nodes_remove = []
dist_s = Dijkstra's(G, s) // dist_s is our dijkstras dictionary
for all nodes v != s:
    if dist(v) > D:
        nodes_remove.add(v)
```

Let $R$ be the same set as nodes_remove in our code. We can build our first set of edges as follows: for all states (u, e, NG), if u is in R, then we do not add any edges to it, where e can be either E or NE, as long as the state stays the same. Here is how this would look:

$ S_1 = \{(u, e, NG) \rightarrow (v, e, NG) | \ u,v \notin R, (u, v) \in E, e \in \{NE ,E \}\}$

$w_2((u, e, NG) \rightarrow (v, e, NG)) = w(u \rightarrow v)$

where $w_2(e), e \in E'$ is our new cost function for our graph $G'$

For all states in (u, e, G), we want to keep them the same simply because all nodes are reachable after we have retrieved gaswhere e can be either E or NE, as long as the state stays the same. Here is how the second set would look:

$ S_2 = \{(u, e, G) \rightarrow (v, e, G) \ | \ (u, v) \in E, e \in \{NE ,E \}\}$

$w_2((u, e, G) \rightarrow (v, e, G)) = w(u \rightarrow v)$

Now we develop our transitions from different layers. If u is an empanada station, then there is an edge from $(u, NE, g) \rightarrow (u, E, g)$, with weight 0. Additionally, if u is a gas station, there is an edge from $(u, e, NG) \rightarrow (u, E, G)$ with a weight of 0. We can define our transition edge set as follows:

$T = \{ (u, e, NG) \rightarrow (u, e, G) \ | \ u \in Y, e \in \{NE ,E\} \} \ \cup \ \{ (u, NE, g) \rightarrow (u, E, g) \ | \ u \in X, g \in \{NG ,G\} \}$

the weight of all the edges in T is 0 because they are transition edges from one state to another, they indicate to use wheter we have visited an empanada station and visited a gas station. Hence we can say that

$$E' = S_1 \cup S_2 \cup T$$

This is still $O(m)$ in terms of size.

Finally, we run Dijkstra's, with our modified weight function $w_2$, now on our new graph G', which consists of all nodes that are reachable from (s, NE, NG). We then take the minimum of shortest path from $(s, NE, NG)$ to $(t, E, NG)$, meaning we didn't have to go to a gas stations and to $(t, E, NG)$, meaning we did go to a gas station. If both cases are reachable in G', then they are valid.

```
dist = Dijkstra's(G', (s, NE, NG)) // dist is our dijkstras dictionary
return min{ dist((t, E, NG)), dist((t, E, G)) }
```

The overall runtime of our algorithm is $O(m + n\log n)$ becasue it is linear to time construct our new graph, and $O(m + n\log n)$ to run dijkstras twice: once on our old and once on our new graph.

### 1. b)

This problem is also involved constructing a new graph, but running a different type of algorithm.

We can construct a new graph $ G' = (V', \ E')$:

$$ V' = V \times \{E, NE \}$$

This is essentially our original graph G with 2 layers, the NE, E represents that the driver has "Not visted the empanda shop" (NE) and
has visited the empanada shop (E).

$$E' = \{(u, e) \rightarrow (v, e) \ | \ (u, v) \in E, e \in \{E, NE \}\} \ \cup \ \{ (u, NE) \rightarrow (u, E) \ | \ u \in Y\}$$

Our new weight function $w_2$ has the same weights from u -> v in the first set of E' and weights of 0 for the second set in E'.

The main algorithm works as follows:

```
FindShortestEmpanadaPath(G, s, t, R):
    G' = InitGPrime             // constructs our new graph
    dist_s = Dijkstras(G', (s, NE))
    if dist_s((t, E)) <= R:     // (t, E) is reachable:
        return dist((t, E))
    else for all vertices x in X:
        if x is reachable from s:
            run Dijkstras on those gas stations, taking the min of all of those in a recursive fashion
            repeat this step until we have run dijkstras on all gas stations
            at a starting gas station we take the min of dist((t, E)) from all of its reachable gas station
```

This algorithm essentially performs Dijkstras on our start node (s, NE) and checks if (t, E) is reachable with our driving distance R. If not, then we consider all reachable gas statations and run Dijkstra's on those to see if those can reach (t, e), and keeping the procedure until we can find the shortest path from (s, NE) to (t, E). The worst case is that almost all of the nodes are gas station, meaing |X| is very close to |V|. Meaning, we would have to run Dijkstra's on every gas station. Therefore, the overall time complexity is $(n(m + n\log n))$

### 2. a)

Maze (digraph), each node has w(v) eggs located at it.
starting a given node s, has to figure out the max number of eggs they can collect (eggs can only be collected once)

1. get SCCs, meaning each has the total number of eggs for each cycl , so now we have our meta graph that is a DAG

2. run BFS longest path

3. linear time

### 2. b)

1. Get SCCs
2. Topological sort the meta graph
3. connect a sentitnal node to each source in our meta graph.
4. then run bfs
5. return any from the source with the longest
6. Do we need to say the actaul source or just the max?

### 2. c)

you restrict eggs so that they can collect eggs from at most k locations, where k is a parameter you give them.

2d dp array

k different runs for DP algorithm
