### SOLUTION

We define MaxChickens(A[1....n]) that returns the max amount of chickens Mr. Fox can earn in an obstacle course given array A[1...n] with the number on the front of the booths. We define it with the following pseudocode:

```
MaxChickens(A[1,...., n]):
    n = |A|
    MaxChickenSubproblem = 2d array set to where A[i][0] represents the Max amount of chickens the farmer can hold from 1 to i saying a "Ring" and A[i][1] represents the same but saying a "Ding"

    // base cases
    if A[1] >= 0:
        MaxChickenSubproblem[1][0] <- A[1]
        MaxChickenSubproblem[1][1] <- 0
    else:
        MaxChickenSubproblem[1][0] <- 0
        MaxChickenSubproblem[1][1] <- -A[1]

    if A[1] + A[2] >= 0:
        MaxChickenSubproblem[2][0] <- A[1] + A[2]
        MaxChickenSubproblem[2][1] <- -A[1]
    else:
        MaxChickenSubproblem[2][0] <- -A[1]
        MaxChickenSubproblem[2][1] <- A[1] + A[2]

    if A[1] + A[2] + A[3] >= 0:
        MaxChickenSubproblem[3][0] <- A[1] + A[2] + A[3]
        MaxChickenSubproblem[3][1] <- -A[2]
    else:
        MaxChickenSubproblem[3][0] <- -A[2]
        MaxChickenSubproblem[3][1] <- A[1] + A[2] + A[3]
    // recursive/normal cases
    for i <- 4 to  n + 1:
        MaxChickenSubproblem[i][0] <- max(MaxChickenSubproblem[i-3][0], MaxChickenSubproblem[i-3][1]) + A[i]
        MaxChickenSubproblem[i][1] <- max(MaxChickenSubproblem[i-3][0], MaxChickenSubproblem[i-3][1]) - A[i]

    return max(MaxChickenSubproblem[n][0], MaxChickenSubproblem[n][1])
```

The number of chickens payed or rewarded at each booth depends on whether Mr. Fox says "Ring!" or "Ding!" at each booth. Therefore, we divide our solution into these recursive subproblems:

Case 1: At booth i: He can say either, where if he says Ring he earns A[i] or loses A[i] if its Ding (from problem description)

Case 2: Where he violates the three times condition: If he says Ring at past 3 booths, he must say Ding next, and vice versa.

Using these cases, we can memoize these outcomes into a 2D array as described in our pseudocode, under the variable MaxChickenSubproblem. We first fill up the first 3 rows of each column (there are 2 columns and |A| rows) with known values from our input array. Then using these values, we can compute every next row in increasing order using the 3rd previous row until we complete the array (row major order).

Furthermore, this will run in $O(n)$ time, as we only traverse through the array once.
