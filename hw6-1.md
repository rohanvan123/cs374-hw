### 1 a.) Here is our Psuedocode

```
MinCostInL(w):
    n <- |w|
    MinCostSubProblem[i] <- [INT_MAX] * (n + 1)
    DP[n + 1] <- 0
    for i <- n to 1
        for j <- i + 1 to n
            substr = w[i...j]
            if isStringInL(substr)
                MinCostSubProblem[i] = min(MinCostSubProblem[i], cost(|substr|) + MinCostSubProblem[j + 1])

    if MinCostSubProblem[1] = INT_MAX
        return "w not in L"
    else
        return MinCostSubProblem[1]

```

Here is a somewhat brief explanation of the algorithm and its time complexity. The function MinCostInL(w) takes in a string and utilizes the blackbox functions cost(x) and isStringInL(x) to ouput the value of a minimum cost L-split of w.

From the beginning we create a 1D dynamic programming cache MinCostSubProblem of length (n + 1). This by default holds a sentinel value of INT_MAX, which is a very large integer, and we set the base case (index n + 1 to avoid out of bounds) to 0 because the cost(0) = 0. MinCostSubproblem[i] ouputs the min cost of w[i...n] as the same specifications in the problem. The functionality of the algorithm works as follows:

1. Iterate through the array backwards using i
2. Iterate forwards from i + 1 to n using j
3. Check if the substring from i to j in w is a string in L
4. If this is true, then set the MinCostSubproblem[i] to be the cost of the substring + the MinCostSubProblem[j + 1]
5. At the end check if our answer MinCostSubproblem[1] still equals our setinel value. If this is true, then return some indication that w itself is not in L, otherwise return that value stored there

The problem is similar to the word dictionary problem with a few minor modifications. When it comes to analyzing the runtime we see that we are iterating backwards, and with each i we iterate forwards, which is already $O(n^2)$. Furthermore, we must consider that at each i, j iteration, we also call substring, and taking the substring of a string is O(n) and isSubstringInL(substr) is also $O(|substr|)$ with these cases the work done interally is $O(n)$ with $O(n^2)$ repititions, leaving us with a overall time complexity of $O(n^3)$.

### 1 b.) Here is our Psuedocode

```
isStringInRegExp(w, r)
    if r = empty set:   // empty set case
        return false
    else if r == x      // single string case
        return w == x
    else if r = s + t   // union
        return isStringInRegExp(w, s) or isStringInRegExp(w, t)
    else if r = st      // concatenation
        for i <- 0 to |w|
            left = w[0....i]
            right = w[i + 1....|w|]
            if (isStringInRegExp(left, s) and  isStringInRegExp(right, t))
                return true
        return false
    else r = s*              // Kleene star
        if |w| == 0
            return true
        for i <- 0 to |w|
            left = w[0....i]
            right = w[i + 1....|w|]
            if (isStringInRegExp(left, s) and  isStringInRegExp(right, r))
                return true
        return false


```

To give a brief explanation of our recursive algorithm. function isStringInRegExp(w, r) takes in a string w and a recursively decomposable regular expression r and outputs true if $ w \in L(r) $ and false if $ w \notin L(r)$.

The function handles 5 cases for our regular expression.

1. The first case is if $r = \empty$. Then, regardless of what w is, the output is false no matter what.

2. The second case is if $r = x$ for some single string x, where x can be the empty string, multiple chars, a single char. For this case we return whether or not w is equal to that string.

3. The third case is if $r = s + t$ (the union of two regular languages s and t). This is the first recursive case where we return true if $w \in L(s)$ <b>or</b> $w \in L(t)$.

4. The fourth case is if $r = s \cdot t$ (the concatenation of two regular languages s and t). To handle this case we iterate from indices 0 up to the length of w. For each iteration, we split w along i into the left and right halves and return true iff left $\in L(s)$ <b>and</b> right $\in L(t)$. If this case holds true for no split, then return false.

5. Finally the fifth case is if $r = s^*$ (r is the Kleene star of some regular expression s). This case is handled simlarly to case 4. If w is the empty string, automatically return true. Otherwise, iterate through w in the same fashion, but this time we check if the left $\in L(s)$ <b>and</b> right $\in L(r)$. We shorten our w into right, and check if the same properties hold for right substring until we have reached the empty string. Again, if this case holds true for no split, then return false.

The function avoids the brute force method of testing every possible string of |w| with our regular expression until it generates w. Instead, it instead tries different cases, each being a definition of a regular language that makes up ours, with some being quite expensive. For example, Kleene star and concatenation require us to iterate through each character in the string. However, under the assumptions that recursive calls are constant time, this algorithm easily follows a polynomial time complexity.
