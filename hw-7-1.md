### 1 a.)

Here is the Psuedocode for our **recursive** algorithm: MinSup(i, j) returns the length of the shortest supersequence between indicices i and j for some global string s

```
MinSup(i, j):
        if i > j:
            return 0
        else if i == j:
            return 1
        else:
            if s[i] == s[j]
                return 2 + MinSup(i + 1, j - 1)
            else
                return 2 + min{MinSup(i + 1, j), MinSup(i, j - 1)}
```

We would return MinSup(1...n)

Base Cases: i > j -> return 0, i == j -> return 1 (because if i and j are the same index, then it is a string of length 1)

Dependencies: MinSup(i + 1, j) (down), MinSup(i, j - 1) (left), MinSup(i + 1, j - 1) (bottom left diagnoal)

Evaluation Order: iterate bottom to top (i) and left to right (j)

Here is the Psuedocode for our **optimized** DP algorithm **solution**:

```
ShortestPalandromicSuperquence(s):
    // Define a 2D array of size n^2
    SPS2 = [1 ... 2, 1 ... n]
    // set the bottom right corner to 1 (i == n == j) case
    SPS[2, n] = 1

    for i <- n - 1 to 1:
        for j <- 1 to n:
            if i > j:
                SPS[1, j] = 0
            else if i == j
                SPS[1, j] = 1
            else:
                if s[i] == s[j]
                    SPS[1, j] = 2 + SPS[2, j - 1]
                else
                    SPS[1, j] = 2 + min{SPS[2, j], SPS[1, j - 1]}
        Set bottom row to first row
        Clear first row

    return SPS[1, n]
```

To provide a brief explanation, this algorithm essentially performs the same functions as the recursive solution using a SPS (Shortest Palandromic Supersequence) cache. The cache is an 2D array of size $O(2n)$ becasue we only need to store the bottom row and values left of the current j index. After we complete a full set of iterations for j, we set the bottom row to the first row and clear the first row. This space optimization turns the space complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ The overall time complexity is $O(n^2)$ because we have iterate from n - 1 to 1 with another (1 to n) for each outer loop iteration. All actions inside of the inner loop are $O(1)$.

### 1 b.)

Here is the Psuedocode for our **recursive** algorithm

```
ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(i, j, k, l):
    if i > j and k > l
        return 0
    else if i > j:
        // algorithm defined in the previous problem
        return ShortestPalandromicSupersequence(y[k...l])
    else if k > l:
        return ShortestPalandromicSupersequence(x[i...j])
    else:
        if !CheckMatch(x[i], x[j], y[k], y[l]) // function to check whether any of the characters match - runs in O(1)
            return 2 + min{
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(i + 1, j, k, l),
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(i, j - 1, k, l),
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(i, j, k + 1, l),
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(i + 1, j, k, l - 1)
            }
        else
            return 2 + min{
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(ChangeIndices(i, j, k, l, x[i])),
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(ChangeIndices(i, j, k, l, x[j])),
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(ChangeIndices(i, j, k, l, y[k])),
                ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(ChangeIndices(i, j, k, l, y[l]))
            }

ChangeIndices(i, j, k, l, char):
    // [P] is a boolean function that returns 1 if true 0 if false - O(1)
    return (i + [x[i] == char], j - [x[j] == char], k + [y[k] == char], l - [y[l] == char])
```

```
SCPSWrapper(x, y):
    // assuming recursive function has access to x and y
    m = |x|
    n = |y|
    return ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(1, n, 1, m)
```

The code above demonstrates the recursive intuition for this problem. To provide a brief explanation, the recursive function ShortestCommonPalandromicSuperquence(i, j, k, l) returns the shortest common palandromic supersequence for the two strings x[i...j] and y[k...l].

The base cases are as follows:

$\bullet$ i > j and k > l, we would return 0 because both strings are empty

$\bullet$ i > j and k <= l, we would call our function ShortestCommonSupersequence(y[k...l]) **(defined in part a)** because i and j indices are invalid and we only care about k...l

$\bullet$ i <= j and k > l, we would call our function ShortestCommonSupersequence(x[i...j]) because k and l indices are invalid and we only care about i...j

For the general case, the logic is quite similar to part a, but there are a few more cases to consider. The first case is if none of the of the correponding characters for i, j, k, l (we call a constant helper function to check this (which isn't defined explicitly but can be)). For this case we then take the minimum of shifting each of the 4 indices, creating 4 different subproblems. The other case is for when there is at least one match. For this, we explicitly declare a helper function ChangeIndices(i,j,k,l, char) which shifts all indices accordingly if their corresponding character is equal to char and returns a tuple of new indices that we can use to call our recursive function. The case takes the minimum of 4 calls, where each involves inputting a different char (all corresponding to the speicifc indices). This is because we need to determine the smallest of the shifts.

**Optimization:**

However, this can be optimized by using a 4D array A[1 ... n, 1... m, 1 ... n, 1 ... m] of size $O(n^2 m^2)$ as our cache. The evaluation order also resembles part a, but is a bit more complicated. We would start at i = n, j = 1, k = n, l = 1 and populate the edge cases accordingly. The program would iterate in a fashion that the dependencies are filled first. Ideally, we could do this as follows:

```
for i <- m to 1
    for j <- 1 to m
        for k <- n to 1
            for l <- 1 to n
                ...
```

Where we calculate table values with this iteration process. Furthermore, we would return A[1, m, 1, n]. The overall time complexity, in the most optimized form, would be $O(n^2 m^2)$. If we cache all the calls from 1 to n and 1 to m for our subroutine ShortestPalandromicSupersequence() into two seperate arrays of lengths m and n respectively, then we would only have to call our modified subroutine function once for each string and can access values in constant time. Hence, the $O(n^2 m^2)$ comes from the four inner loops.
