## 1. a

Suppose there are two MSTs $T$ and $T'$, such that $T'$ is the local optimum tree.

In the case that $T$ is already the local optimum tree, i.e., $T = T'$: We have no more work to do as there exists no such edge $e'$ such that $T' = T - e' + e$ is cheaper than $T$ and we have proved that a local optimal tree is a MST.

In the case that the local optimal tree is not the MST, i.e., $T$ is not $T'$, we will proceed with a proof by contradiction.

In this case, we know that there must be at least one different edge between $T$ and $T'$ if they are not equal. Suppose $e = (u,v) \in T$ is the one with the edge difference, then we cannot simply perform one swap for a better cost (since the path length from $u$ to $v$ in in $T'$ must be greater than 1, where the cost of the path must be less than the cost of $e$ according to the described algorithm).

If we apply the algorithm again to T, since T is not at the base case of the local optimum tree yet in our contradiction, then we would have to cut the edge to satisfy the requirements described in the algorithm. However, this means that there must be a spanning tree with a cost less than the MST which is not possible by the definition of a MST, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the local optimal tree must be the MST.
